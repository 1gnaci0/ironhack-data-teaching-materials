    "## What is Version Control and why should you care?\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](../static/suspicious_fry_magic.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. We will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIT is a VCS system designed with the following goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple design\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fully distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Not enough reasons to learn GIT. Well, **it is an absolute industry standard** so... deal with it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## GIT´s graph model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Git models the history of your projects as [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (a DAG). Let us understand these three words:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Graph** is a way to model connected things. More technically, a graph is a collection of \"nodes\" connected by \"edges\". Think for example of a social network, where individuals are the nodes and relationships are the \"edges\" (a.k.a. links).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Acyclic** means that the graph contains no circles. This means that you cannot find a path where you start and finish on the same node following the direction of the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Directed** means that the edges can only go in one direction. Think for example of \"parent\", \"child\", and the relationship \"is son of\" --- nope, you cannot be parent and child of the same person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **graph as a whole** contains a [project's history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuRd_Eneuk8). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nodes** in Git represent commits (remember: snapshots of your project). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **edges** point from a commit to its parents. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A **branch** occurs if a commit has more than one child. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A **merge** occurs when a commit has more than one parent. \n",

    "* The **working space** (or working tree) contains the files for a single commit. Simply put, it is where your work happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Index** (or staging area) keeps track of the files that will be included in the next commit. It is what you want to include in the next commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **local repository** contains all of the commits of the project. The Index and local repository are located in a hidden .git directory in your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **remote repository** (such as GitHub) contains the commits of the project but on a remote location. It is where you usually share and collaborate, and it is normally considered the source of truth.\n",
